    Learned about Machine Learning, Software engineering, and Data
    Science. My graduation project was titled <span class="italic underline"> Conception et implementation d'un system décionnel à la base d'une infrastructure GSM </span> in French. The idea is to design a decisional system prototype that can be controlled via GSM and use data from different APIs endpoints and sensors so the system can make a decision by itself. I enjoyed a lot working on this project. We built a farm prototype using Arduino and ArduinoGSMShield to send/receive commands from a smartphone application via SMS. The data
    was stored/consumed from an API endpoint in a remote server built with PHP Laravel and MySQL database.

      During these 3 years, We learned about data structures, algorithms, and programming in general. I had the chance to learn different languages and tools like Pascal, Python, SQL, give presentations, and explaining algorithms by building scripts e.g <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/abachi/k-means">K-means</a>.
